 Menhera Game using Unity

Game Summary
This is a pixel-art horror game where the player is trapped by a yandere (menhera) girlfriend. At the start, she brings the protagonist into the bedroom, giving them 5 seconds to run. After that, the player enters the living room and has 15 seconds to make a key decision—like hiding in the closet or grabbing a kitchen knife.

If the player fails to decide within those 15 seconds, the menhera girlfriend chases them relentlessly, and the player’s only option is to run; if caught, a jumpscare death occurs. If they do choose (hide in closet, etc.), a cutscene plays, each leading to a unique death sequence.

The game focuses on:

Quick decision-making and tense time limits.
AI-driven chasing when the timer runs out.
Multiple horrific death animations, all presented in a cinematic pixel-art style.
Extension features like a secret ending and AI that remembers the player’s hiding spots in repeated playthroughs.
