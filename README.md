## A pixel horror experience created as a portfolio piece to showcase programming, artistic and japanese skills in just 10-15 minutes.

You went to your girlfriend's house

Something is wrong.

She's too kind. Too sweet.

And behind her smile… is something waiting.


Explore. Decide.

But no matter what you do

She will always find you.

### Table Death
Desperate cover leads to a stabbing frenzy from above.

### Corpse Devour Death
Lights go out. She eats you. You see your remains.

The tea she made for you… makes your stomach swell, then explode with worms.

### 16 pixel art portraits for dialogue, capturing the MC and Yandere’s emotional tension.
